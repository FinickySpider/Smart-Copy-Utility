1. Read through ALL files in `docs/`.
2. Write your design doc at `docs/design/DESIGN.md` using `Design-Document.md` as the core design to populate everything from. Template for design document is found in: (template: `docs/templates/design-doc.md`).
3. Populate all of the following once `docs/design/DESIGN.md` is complete, using it as the core design document moving forward:
   - phases: `docs/phases/PHASE-XX-*.md`
   - sprints: `docs/sprints/SPRINT-XX.md`
   - work items: `docs/features`, `docs/bugs`, `docs/refactors`
   - ADRs: `docs/decisions/ADR-XXXX-*.md`
   - master index: `docs/index/MASTER_INDEX.md`
4. Generate custom agent instructions for copilot (in the .github folder) based on this individual project and SPECIFICALLY: `docs/_system/agent-guidance.md` as a source of the MOST IMPORTANT RULES.
5. Do a final pass over everything and ensure everything has been created according to the rules, and the project is ready to begin.
