## Human steps

1. Copy `docs/` into your repo
2. Write your design doc: `docs/design/DESIGN.md` (template: `docs/templates/design-doc.md`)
3. Give your agent the design doc and point it at `docs/`

## Agent instructions (copy-paste)

- Read `docs/design/DESIGN.md`
- Follow `docs/_system/agent-guidance.md`
- Create phases, sprints, and initial work items in `/docs`
- Keep scope strictly inside the design doc
- Record architecture choices as ADRs
- Update `docs/index/MASTER_INDEX.md`
