# Docs System Overview

This system keeps a coding agent deterministic and aligned.

## Canon

- `docs/index/MASTER_INDEX.md` is the single source of truth.
- The agent starts there.
- Only work listed in the active sprint is allowed.

## Directory map

- `docs/design/` Design documents
- `docs/index/` Master Index and Roadmap
- `docs/phases/` Phases (strategic groupings)
- `docs/sprints/` Sprints (execution windows)
- `docs/features/` Feature specs
- `docs/bugs/` Bug specs
- `docs/refactors/` Refactor specs
- `docs/decisions/` ADRs (decision records)
- `docs/templates/` Templates for everything
